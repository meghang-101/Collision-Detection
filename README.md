# Collision-Detection
This project uses an ULTRASONIC SENSOR, multiple LEDs and a PIEZO BUZZER for indication. We can also add a LCD module to be interfaced with the arduino for cirtain commands that can be read by the user. 
The indication system consists of 3 layers- 1)With only one LED glowing and small synchronous beep, 2)With 2 LEDs glowing and fast synchronous beep, 3)With all LEDs glowing and continuous beep. The 3 layers of indication will depend on the value which is send by the sensor to the arduino. 
We can improve the system by using a RELAY MODULE that gets the input from the arduino. The relay will perform secondary tasks like braking system or pneumatic system for stopping the vehicle or any other precautionary actions.
